# LilRisk

LilRisk is a desktop application that allows users to “pseudo invest” in different portfolios.  You can test out different strategies by creating a new portfolio, and watch how each one works over time.  The interface will be very clean and simple, and we are aiming our product at people who don’t have a lot of experience with investment.  You will easily be able to “buy” and “sell” crypto-currencies in each portfolio, and watch each grow over time in correlation to others.
